# The End

# It may be a good idea to create an /etc/lfs-release file. By having this 
# file, it is very easy for you (and for us if you need to ask for help at 
# some point) to find out which MLFS version is installed on the system. 
# Create this file by running: 
echo 1.0.0 > /etc/optimux-release

# It is also a good idea to create a file to show the status of your new 
# system with respect to the Linux Standards Base (LSB). To create this file, run: 
cat > /etc/lsb-release << "EOF"
DISTRIB_ID="Optimux"
DISTRIB_RELEASE="1.0.0"
DISTRIB_CODENAME="<your name here>"
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Optimized Musl Linux From Scratch"
EOF

# If desired, an os-release file
cat > /usr/lib/os-release << "EOF"
NAME="Optimux"
VERSION="1.0.0"

PRETTY_NAME="Optimized Musl Linux From Scratch 1.0.0"

# freedesktop.org defines that file can be in /etc or /usr/lib
ln -sv ../usr/lib/os-release /etc/

## Rebooting the System 

# Exit chroot and unmount MLFS
logout
umount -v $OML/dev/pts
umount -v $OML/dev
umount -v $OML/run
umount -v $OML/proc
umount -v $OML/sys

# Unmount if MLFS is on a seperate partition or HDD/SDD/device
umount -v $OML

# You may reboot your machine [if host and target are the same]
