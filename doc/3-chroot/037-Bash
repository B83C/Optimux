# Apply patches from Clear Linux:

# Apply patch to fix a missing dependency on a constructed 
# file, which can cause highly parellel builds to fail.
patch -Np0 -i ../patches/bash-clear/bash51-001.patch

# Apply patch: If there are no jobs, and the `-n' and `-p' 
# options are both supplied to `wait', bash can assign a 
# value to the variable name specified with `-p' instead 
# of leaving it unset.
patch -Np0 -i ../patches/bash-clear/bash51-002.patch 

# Apply patch: Bash does not put a command substitution 
# process that is started to perform an expansion in a 
# child process into the right process group where it can 
# receive keyboard-generated signals.
patch -Np0 -i ../patches/bash-clear/bash51-003.patch

# Apply Patch: This patch makes key-value assignment and 
# subscript assignment perform the same expansions when 
# they're supplied as an argument to `declare'.
patch -Np0 -i ../patches/bash-clear/bash51-004.patch

# Apply Patch: Fix two memory leaks when assigning arrays 
# using compound assignment syntax.
patch -Np0 -i ../patches/bash-clear/bash51-005.patch

# Make sure child processes forked to run command 
# substitutions are in theproper process group.
patch -Np0 -i ../patches/bash-clear/bash51-006.patch

# Apply Patch: The code to check readline versions in an 
# inputrc file had the sense of the comparisons reversed.
patch -Np0 -i ../patches/bash-clear/bash51-007.patch

# Apply patch: Process substitution FIFOs opened by child 
# processes as targets of redirections were not removed 
# appropriately, leaving remnants in the file system.
